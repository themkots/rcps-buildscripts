<!--
It helps to give us as much information about the application as you know.
 Below are some things that really help.
 Please delete any bits you don't know or don't need.
 Any text contained in these arrows will be hidden in the final result.
-->

<!-- 
The name and version of the application you need should go here. If you don't need a specific version, we'll usually go for the latest release marked "stable". 

Please also put this in the subject of the issue!
-->
Application: MyApp version 19.05

Link: <https://example.com/>

<!--
We generally install software on all the clusters unless licensing or technical problems prevent that. It's still useful to let us know which clusters you plan to use the software on, though.
-->
Cluster: Myriad

<!-- 
A bit of description helps: a line or two about what the application does, as you'd describe it to a colleague. This lets us make sure we have the right thing, and helps other users who might be looking for something similar.
-->
Description: does processing to text data for philosophical research.

<!--
Licensing: if you know what kind of software license the application is provided under, let us know. We can look this up if you not sure, but knowing in advance whether it's commercial or open-source software helps. 
If it's commercial software, we may need you to provide us with a bundle or installer. In this case, uploading it to the cluster you need it installed on is the quickest way to get it to us.
In some cases, awkward licenses may cause problems here, but we'll find out whether this is the case.
-->
License: open source, GPL-licensed.

<!--
Special versions or variants: sometimes people need a version compiled with a particular optional feature enabled, or an optional library compiled in. Let us know here if that's the case.
-->
Special versions or variants: I need the optional "twiddle geometry" module.

<!--
Incident number: if you already have a ticket in our email support system about this, it helps to put the ID number here. These start with "IN", a colon, and then a number, e.g. IN:03527651. You can find it in the subject of the email you received back when the ticket was created.

Ticket number: IN:00000000
